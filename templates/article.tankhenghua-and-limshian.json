Actors spend loads of time on themselves, and don’t get me wrong, it’s necessary to do that for the most part.<\/p><p><\/p><p>[start:#808080]Shi-An:[end:#808080] I agree with mummy. Acting can be a very self-centred experience and having my design jobs is a necessary contrast to remind me how to be a part of a team and to put the needs of everyone before mine. Design is also an introverted activity which balances out my acting life well. Acting is cathartic, but design is therapeutic and it helps me centre my emotions before diving back into an acting gig.<\/p>"
